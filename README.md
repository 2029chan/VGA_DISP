# VGA_disp
This project implements a VGA controller to display text on a VGA monitor, specifically rendering my name. The design uses fundamental VGA signal generation principles to output characters onto the screen.

Key Features:
   Basic VGA protocol handling using Verilog.
   Custom text rendering onto a VGA screen.
   Smooth and consistent frame updates.
Usage:
   Navigate to the VGA project directory.
   Synthesize the Verilog code using your preferred FPGA toolchain and upload it to your FPGA board.
   Connect the FPGA to a VGA monitor to see the output.
